Visualizing Nexus of Porous Architecture and Reactive Transport in Heterogeneous Catalysis by Deep Learning Computer Vision and Transfer Learning
"1d.py and 3d.py contain the cGAN code for image-to-image mapping, which is used for predicting local reaction rates.
3DCNN.py is the code for the 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) used for image-to-Rnorm mapping, which helps in predicting the overall reaction rate.
